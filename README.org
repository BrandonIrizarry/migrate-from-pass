* Summary
This script decrypts the contents of my password store (as managed by
the ~pass~ program) and outputs the result to Eshell.

At the Eshell top-level, one can then append this to an existing
buffer using Eshell's buffer redirection operator (~>>>~).

Certain assumptions are made about the environment. I leave it as an
exercise to the reader to figure out under which distro this was
written. ğŸ˜€
